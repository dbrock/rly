Usage: rly -d TEST-DIRS...
   or: rly -f TEST-FILES...

Run one or more simple, command-line tests.

With \`-d', run \`rly -f' on all executable files in TEST-DIRS.
With \`-f', execute each TEST-FILE and make sure that it exits with zero.

Furthermore, if there is a file called \`TEST-FILE.expected', then also
make sure that the stdout of that test matches this file exactly.

If a test fails, save its output to \`TEST-FILE.actual' and then stop.
The \`TEST-FILE.actual' file will be removed when the test succeeds.
